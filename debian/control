Package: eatmydata
Architecture: all
Depends:

 ${misc:Depends},

Description: Library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

Description: Library and utilities to disable fsync and friends - shared library
 This package contains the actual LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) supporting
 the operation of the eatmydata package. Users typically want to use or depend
 on the eatmydata package instead of this one, so see its description for
 further information.

Description: Disable fsync and friends during installation to speed up the install
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.

 This package provides the files to enable eatmydata during a Debian install as
 performed by debian-installer.
